# AWS - S3 (Simple Storage Service)

## S3 Characteristics

- First service launched by AWS (March 2006)
- S3 is not a file system, it's a cloud based object storage solution
- Stores data at region level (Unless [cross-region replication](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/crr.html) is used)
- Supports REST and SOAP APIs
- Bucket names are unique across of all AWS
- Offers server-side encryption of data at rest

## S3 Storage Classes

### STANDARD

- 99.99999999999% durability
- 99.99% availability

### STANDARD_IA (Infrequent Access)

- 99.99999999999% durability
- 99.99% availability
- There is a retrieval fee associated with STANDARD_IA objects which makes it most suitable for infrequently accessed data. For pricing information, see [Amazon S3 Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/).

### GLACIER

- 99.99999999999% durability
- 99.99% availability (after objects are restored)
- GLACIER objects are not available for real-time access.  You must first restore archived objects before you can   access them.

### RRS (Reduced Redundancy Storage)

- 99.99% durability (possible loss of 0.01 per year)
- 99.99% availability
- Reduced costs at the cost of reliability

## S3 Features

### Single region replication

- Default replication model
- Replicates objects across availability zones on same region
- RRS doesn't replicate to so many devices, hence the lower durability percentage
- S3 doesn't mark an object as successfully stored until all devices confirm replication success
- Calculates checksums on all S3 traffic

### Versioning

You can use versioning to preserve, retrieve, and restore every version of every object stored in your Amazon S3 bucket

![versioning](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/images/versioning_Enabled.png)

- If you delete an object, instead of removing it permanently, Amazon S3 inserts a delete marker, which becomes the current object version. You can always restore the previous version.
- If you overwrite an object, it results in a new object version in the bucket.
- You can always restore the previous version

### Cross-region replication

#### Use-Case Scenarios

- Compliance requirements
- Minimize latency
- Operational reasons
- Maintain object copies under different ownership

#### CRR Requisites

- Source and destination buckets must have versioning enabled
- Source and destination buckets must be on different AWS regions
- S3 must have permissions to replicate objects on both buckets on your behalf (created through IAM roles)
- If source bucket owner doesn't own object, READ and READ_ACP permissions need to be granted through object ACL
- If cross account bucket ownership is desired, the IAM role used must have permission to replicate objects on the destination bucket.

### MFA Delete

If a bucket's versioning configuration is MFA Delete–enabled, the bucket owner must include the x-amz-mfa request header in requests to permanently delete an object version or change the versioning state of the bucket.

Multifactor authentication delete is only available through API.

Example DELETE

```language
DELETE /my-image.jpg?versionId=3HL4kqCxf3vjVBH40Nrjfkd HTTPS/1.1
Host: bucketName.s3.amazonaws.com
x-amz-mfa: 20899872 301749
Date: Wed, 28 Oct 2009 22:32:00 GMT
Authorization: AWS AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE:0RQf4/cRonhpaBX5sCYVf1bNRuU=
```

### Time limited access to objects

S3 allows you to set up access to objects for a limited time frame.

### Server access logs

Each access log record provides details about a single access request, such as the requester, bucket name, request time, request action, response status, and error code, if any.

There is no extra charge for enabling server access logging on an Amazon S3 bucket; however, any log files that the system delivers to you accrue the usual charges for storage.

Server access log records are delivered on a best effort basis. However, the completeness and timeliness of server logging is not guaranteed. The log record for a particular request might be delivered long after the request was actually processed, or it might not be delivered at all.

By default, logging is disabled.

### Event notifications

The Amazon S3 notification feature enables you to receive notifications when certain events happen in your bucket.

#### Event notification types

| Event Types | Description |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| s3:ObjectCreated:* s3:ObjectCreated:Put s3:ObjectCreated:Post s3:ObjectCreated:Copy s3:ObjectCreated:CompleteMultipartUpload | You can enable notification when an object is created using a specific API, or you can use the s3:ObjectCreated:* event type to request notification regardless of the API that was used to create an object. You will not receive event notifications from failed operations. |
| s3:ObjectRemoved:* s3:ObjectRemoved:Delete s3:ObjectRemoved:DeleteMarkerCreated | You can enable notification when an object or a batch of objects is removed from a bucket. You will not receive event notifications from automatic deletes from lifecycle policies or from failed operations. |
| s3:ReducedRedundancyLostObject | You can use this event type to request Amazon S3 to send a notification message when Amazon S3 detects that an object of the RRS storage class is lost. |

#### Supported Destinations

- Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic
- Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue
- AWS Lambda by invoking a Lambda function and providing the event message as an argument

##### At this time S3 supports only standard SQS queues that are not server-side encryption (SSE) enabled

### Object lifecycle management

The configuration is a set of one or more rules, where each rule defines an action for Amazon S3 to apply to a group of objects.

#### Supported actions

- Transition actions – In which you define when objects transition to another storage class.
- Expiration actions – In which you specify when the objects expire.

#### Use Cases

You can define lifecycle configuration rules for objects that have a well-defined lifecycle.

For example:

- If you are uploading periodic logs to your bucket, your application might need these logs for a week or a month after creation, and after that you might want to delete them.
- Some documents are frequently accessed for a limited period of time. After that, these documents are less frequently accessed. Over time, you might not need real-time access to these objects, but your organization or regulations might require you to archive them for a longer period and then optionally delete them later.
- You might also upload some types of data to Amazon S3 primarily for archival purposes, for example digital media archives, financial and healthcare records, raw genomics sequence data, long-term database backups, and data that must be retained for regulatory compliance.

### Access Control Methods

By default, all Amazon S3 resources—buckets, objects, and related subresources (for example, lifecycle configuration and website configuration) are private.

#### Resource-based policies

- ACLs (access control lists): Each bucket and object has an ACL associated with it. An ACL is a list of grants identifying grantee and permission granted. You use ACLs to grant basic read/write permissions to other AWS accounts. ACLs use an Amazon S3–specific XML schema.
- Bucket policies: You can add a bucket policy to grant other AWS accounts or IAM users permissions for the bucket and the objects in it. Any object permissions apply only to the objects that the bucket owner creates. Bucket policies supplement, and in many cases, replace ACL-based access policies.![resource_based_policies](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/images/resource-based-policy.png)

#### User policies

- You can use IAM to manage access to your Amazon S3 resources.![iam_policy](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/images/user-policy.png)

#### REST request authentication

The Amazon S3 REST API uses a custom HTTP scheme based on a keyed-HMAC (Hash Message Authentication Code) for authentication.

When the system receives an authenticated request, it fetches the AWS secret access key that you claim to have and uses it in the same way to compute a signature for the message it received. It then compares the signature it calculated against the signature presented by the requester. If the two signatures match, the system concludes that the requester must have access to the AWS secret access key and therefore acts with the authority of the principal to whom the key was issued.

Example authenticated request

```language
GET /photos/puppy.jpg HTTP/1.1
Host: johnsmith.s3.amazonaws.com
Date: Mon, 26 Mar 2007 19:37:58 +0000

Authorization: AWS AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE:frJIUN8DYpKDtOLCwo//yllqDzg=
```
